# ðŸ’»ðŸ§  Machine Learning with Python: Car Price Prediction ðŸš—

I developed a Machine Learning project using Python, where I worked with a car price dataset. I implemented a predictive Linear Regression model to predict vehicle prices. I used data preprocessing techniques, such as cleaning and transformation, to optimize the model's performance. This project not only allowed me to deepen my skills in Python and Machine Learning but also to gain valuable insights into the factors that influence car prices.
